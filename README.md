# Logos Package Manager Module

## Building with Nix (Recommended)

### Outputs
- `.#logos-package-manager-lib`: builds the plugin library (`package_manager_plugin.{dylib|so}`)
- `.#logos-package-manager-include`: generates C/C++ headers from the built plugin
- `.#default`: combined output exposing both `lib/` and `include/`

### Build the module
```bash
nix build
```

Or build specific outputs:
```bash
nix build .#logos-package-manager-lib
nix build .#logos-package-manager-include
nix build .#default
```

### Enter development shell
```bash
nix develop
```

### Build manually in development shell
```bash
nix develop
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -GNinja ..
ninja
```

## Building with CMake

If you don't want to use Nix, you can build directly with CMake:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -GNinja \
  -DLOGOS_CPP_SDK_ROOT=/path/to/logos-cpp-sdk \
  -DLOGOS_LIBLOGOS_ROOT=/path/to/logos-liblogos \
  ..
ninja
```

## Generated headers

When building via Nix, headers are generated by `logos-cpp-generator` from the
compiled plugin (`package_manager_plugin.{dylib,so}`) and installed under
`$out/include`. The include-only derivation can be built with:

```bash
nix build .#logos-package-manager-include
```
